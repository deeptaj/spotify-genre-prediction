# About
In this project, we sought to explore the potential of using Spotify data to predict the genre of a song. By doing so, we can potentially improve the organization and recommendation of music on the platform, as well as gain insight into the characteristics that define different music genres. We also sought to understand the predictive power of lyrics – sourced from Genius.com – in comparison to song attributes from Spotify when it comes to determining music genre. This project serves as an introduction to the application of machine learning in the field of music and the potential benefits it can bring.
